### What is a Z-Score?

A z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is.

### The Z-Score Formula

    z = (x – μ) / σ
    
    μ = population mean
    σ = populations standard deviation

### Example Equation

You score 1100 on your SAT.  The **mean** score for the SAT is 1026, and the **standard deviation** is 209.

How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?

#### Step 1
Write your X-value (your test score) into the z-score equation.
    
    Z = (1100 - μ) / σ
    
#### Step 2
Include the **mean** and **standard deviation** in the equation.

    Z = (1100 - 1026) / 209
    
#### Step 3
Calculate the answer to determine how many **standard deviations** your score was away from the mean.

    Z = 0.354
  
Your score was **0.354 standard deviations above the mean**.
